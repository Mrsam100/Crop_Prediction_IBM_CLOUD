# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System (IBM watsonx.ai Studio)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is an AI-powered project developed and deployed using **IBM watsonx.ai Studio**.  
It analyzes soil nutrients and environmental conditions to recommend the most suitable crop, helping farmers increase productivity and adopt sustainable farming practices.  

This project demonstrates how **AI on IBM Cloud** can solve real-world agricultural challenges.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to select the right crop due to:
- Lack of awareness about soil nutrients & fertility.
- Dependence on traditional knowledge instead of scientific data.
- Unpredictable climate conditions affecting yield.
- Limited access to agricultural experts in rural areas.

➡️ Our solution leverages **AI/ML on IBM watsonx.ai Studio** to provide **personalized, data-driven crop recommendations**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Built and deployed on **IBM watsonx.ai Studio**.  
- ✅ Predicts the best crop for given soil/environmental values.  
- ✅ Uses a **machine learning classification model**.  
- ✅ Provides probabilities for each possible crop.  
- ✅ Can be extended into mobile/web apps for farmers.
